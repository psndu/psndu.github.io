<h2>What I'm Doing Now</h2>
<p>Updated on 23rd June, 2024, from my home in Malabe, Colombo, Sri Lanka. It's hot and dry with bursts of rain here and there.</p>
<h3>Brushing up my HTML and CSS knowledge</h3>
<p>I decided to host this site on Github pages for free. I've been coding the HTML and CSS for this simple website. Lots of help from YouTube and W3Schools.</p>
<h3>VISA work</h3>
<p>Starting this week, I'll have some work to do in getting my student visa. Mainly document checking and verifying. Boring, but completing this process will open a new chapter for me.</p>
<h3>Final month of work</h3>
<p>Less than 40 days of work remaining till I leave my position at MAS as a junior associate - finance. Focused on ending in good terms with the people at MAS.</p>
<h3>Football and entertainment</h3>
<p>UEFA Euros and CONMEBOL Copa America has been my main source of entertainment past week. Supporitng Argentina in Copa, neutral fan in EUROs. Other than that, TIktok, Twitter, WWE and YouTube gonna entertain me.</p>
